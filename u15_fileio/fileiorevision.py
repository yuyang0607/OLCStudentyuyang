# file_creation.py
# Creates the text files needed for the File IO practice questions

# fileio stands for "file input output"
# Purpose of fileio: to store data permanently as without fileio, all code will be gone when tab is closed without file
# r - read
# w - write
# a - append

# # .write(), .read()
# with open("sales.txt", "w") as fobj:
#     fobj.write("TOday's sales is $1000.")

# # "w" is destructive. if files exists, it will overwrite
# ## read
# with open("sales.txt", "r") as fobj:
# #    content = fobj.readline() # reads the entire contents of file, store as a string
#     content = fobj.readlines()
# print(content)

# fruits = ["apple\n","banana\n","watermelon\n"]

# FILE IO PRACTICE QUESTIONS
# Focus: open(), .read(), .readlines(), .write(), .writelines()
# Modes: "r", "w", "a"
# =========================================================

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Question 1
# Basic reading using "r" and .read()
#
# A text file q1_greeting.txt contains the text:
# Hello and welcome to Python File IO.
#
# Write a program to:
# 1. Open the file in read mode
# 2. Read the full contents using .read()
# 3. Display the contents on the screen
#
# Write your code below.
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# with open("q1_greeting.txt", "r") as fobj:
#     content = fobj.read()
# print(content)

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Question 2
# Basic writing using "w" and .write()
#
# Write a program to create a text file called q2_note.txt.
#
# The program should:
# 1. Open the file in write mode
# 2. Write the following text into the file:
#    Today I learnt how to write to a file.
# 3. Close the file
#
# After writing, open the file again in read mode
# and display its contents.
#
# Write your code below.
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# with open("q2_note.txt", "w") as fobj:
#     fobj.write("Today I learnt how to write a file")

#     content = fobj.read()
# print(content)

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Question 3
# Appending using "a" and .write()
#
# A text file q3_diary.txt already contains:
# I went to school today.
#
# Write a program to:

# 2. Add this new line at the end of the file (next line):
#    I also revised Python at night.
# 3. Close the file
# 4. Open the file again and display the full contents
#
# Write your code below.

# with a comma between each value.
#
# The current contents of q8_animal_names.txt are:
# cat,dog,rabbit,hamster
#
# A text file q8_animal_sounds.txt stores a list of animal sounds
# with a comma between each value.
#
# The current contents of q8_animal_sounds.txt are:
# meow,bark,squeak,peep
#
# Write a program to:
# 1. Read the data from both files
# 2. Split the values using the comma delimiter
# 3. Create a dictionary where:
#    - the animal is the key
#    - the sound is the value
# 4. Display the completed dictionary
#
# The program should work for files of any length.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Question 9
# Validation and error reporting
#
# A text file q9_scores.txt contains one value per line:
# 56
# 72
# abc
# 91
# -4
# 105

#
# Write a program to read the file and check whether each line
# is a valid score.
#
# A valid score:
# - must be an integer
# - must be between 0 and 100 inclusive
#
# The program should:
# 1. Read all lines from the file
# 2. Separate the data into:
#    - valid scores
#    - invalid entries

# Each line stores:
# category,amount
#
# Write a program to:
# 1. Read all lines from the file
# 2. Calculate the total amount spent
# 3. Calculate the total spent for each category

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Question 11 [25 marks]
#
# A text file q11_sales.txt contains one sales record per line.
# Each line has the format:
# item_name,quantity,unit_price
#
# The current contents of q11_sales.txt are:
# Pen,12,1.5
# Book,5,4.8
# Eraser,20,0.6
# Pencil,10,1.2
# Ruler,3,2.5
#
# A program is required to read the sales data, process it,
# and write a report into a new text file called sales_report.txt.
#
# The report should contain:
# - the total value for each item
# - the grand total value of all items
# - the name of the item with the highest total value

# Write program code to perform this task.
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# You must use the following functions:
# (a) read_sales()                                         [5]
#     This function reads the data from q11_sales.txt.
#     It should return a nested list containing all sales records.
#     Each inner list should store:
#     - item name
#     - quantity as an integer
#     - unit price as a float
# Write your code below.
# ---------------------------------------------------------














# ---------------------------------------------------------
# (b) calculate_total(record)                              [4]
#     This function receives one sales record.
#     It should return the total value of that record.
#     total value = quantity x unit price
# Write your code below.
# ---------------------------------------------------------
















# ---------------------------------------------------------
# (c) write_report(records)                                [9]
#     This function receives the nested list of sales records.
#     It should:
#     - calculate the total value for each item
#     - calculate the grand total value
#     - determine the item with the highest total value (Best Selling Item)
#     - write the report into sales_report.txt

# Example contents of sales_report.txt:
# Pen: 18.0
# Book: 24.0
# Eraser: 12.0
# Pencil: 12.0
# Ruler: 7.5
# Grand Total: 73.5
# Best Selling Item: Book
#
# Write your code below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# (d) Main program                                         [3]
#     The main program should:
#     - call read_sales()
#     - call write_report(records)
#     - display the message:
#       Report created successfully
#
